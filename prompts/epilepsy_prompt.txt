You are tasked with extracting specific patient information from a provided medical record text.

The input consists of a concatenation of multiple clinical reports from the same patient, sometimes across different dates. Your goal is to extract accurate and comprehensive information for each of the fields below, selecting the most appropriate value based on the relevant time context.

Carefully read all reports and determine the correct values according to the following rules:
	1.	Patient ID
Extract the unique identifier for the patient. This could be a code or number in the report.
	2.	Age
Provide the patient’s age in years. Use the value from the earliest report where age is mentioned.
	3.	Sex
Indicate the patient’s biological sex using the terms “male”, “female”.
	4.	Diagnosis of Epilepsy or Seizures
Indicate whether the patient has a diagnosis of epilepsy or has experienced seizures. Answer should be “yes” or “no”.
	5.	Focal Epilepsy
If epilepsy is present, indicate whether it is focal in nature. “yes” or “no”.
	6.	Generalized Epilepsy
If epilepsy is present, indicate whether it is generalized. “yes” or “no”.
	7.	Current Medications
List the generic names of medications the patient is currently taking. Include dose and dose unit (e.g., “levetiracetam 500 mg BID”).
Use the most recent report that contains this information.
	8.	Previous Medications
List medications that the patient used in the past but discontinued. Include the name, dose (if mentioned), and the reason for discontinuation.
Example: “valproate 500 mg - discontinued due to weight gain.”
	9.	Seizure Frequency
Provide seizure frequency in number of seizures per month.
Example: “3 per month”.
	10.	Duration of Epilepsy
Report how long the patient has had epilepsy, in years.
Example: “10 years”.
	11.	Status Epilepticus
Indicate if the patient has ever experienced status epilepticus. “yes” or “no”.
	12.	Seizure Location
Report anatomical location(s) of the seizures if mentioned.
Examples: “left temporal”, “bilateral frontal”.
	13.	Hippocampal Sclerosis
Indicate presence of hippocampal sclerosis. “yes”, “no”, or “unknown”.
	14.	Focal Cortical Dysplasia
Indicate presence of focal cortical dysplasia. “yes”, “no”, or “unknown”.
	15.	Febrile Seizures
Indicate whether the patient had febrile seizures in childhood. “yes”, “no”, or “unknown”.
	16.	Ischemic Stroke
Indicate whether the patient had an ischemic stroke. “yes”, “no”, or “unknown”.
	17.	Hemorrhagic Stroke
Indicate whether the patient had a hemorrhagic stroke. “yes”, “no”, or “unknown”.
	18.	Traumatic Brain Injury
Indicate whether the patient had a traumatic brain injury. “yes”, “no”, or “unknown”.
	19.	Neuroinfection
Indicate whether the patient had a neuroinfection (e.g., meningitis, encephalitis). “yes”, “no”, or “unknown”.
	20.	Psychiatric Comorbidity
Indicate if the patient has any psychiatric conditions such as depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder.
Example: “Major depressive disorder”.
	21.	Heart Failure
Indicate whether the patient has heart failure. “yes”, “no”, or “unknown”.
	22.	Diabetes Mellitus
Indicate whether the patient has diabetes. “yes”, “no”, or “unknown”.
	23.	Earliest Report Date
Extract the date of the earliest report. Use format YYYY-MM-DD.
	24.	Latest Report Date
Extract the date of the most recent report. Use format YYYY-MM-DD.
	25.	Drug-Resistant Epilepsy
Indicate if the epilepsy is refractory (i.e., seizures continue despite trial of at least two medications). “yes” or “no”.
	26.	Seizure-Free Status
Indicate whether the patient is currently seizure-free. “yes” or “no”.
	27.	Last Seizure Date
If provided, extract the date of the patient’s last seizure. Use format YYYY-MM-DD.
	28.	MRI Abnormal
Indicate whether the MRI was described as abnormal. “yes” or “no”.
	29.	MRI Findings Summary
Provide a short summary of abnormal MRI findings.
Example: “mesial temporal sclerosis on the left side”.
	30.	Interictal Spikes Present
Indicate if EEG reports show interictal epileptiform discharges (spikes or sharp waves). “yes”, “no”, or “unknown”.
	31.	Ictal Pattern Captured
Indicate whether an ictal EEG pattern was captured during a seizure. “yes”, “no”, or “unknown”.
	32.	EEG Lateralization
Describe any reported lateralization from EEG findings.
Example: “right temporal”, “generalized”.
	33.	Epilepsy Surgery Done
Indicate if the patient has undergone epilepsy surgery. “yes” or “no”.
	34.	Type of Epilepsy Surgery
If surgery was performed, describe the type.
Example: “anterior temporal lobectomy”.
	35.	Surgical Outcome
Report the outcome if mentioned, such as Engel class or percent seizure reduction.
Example: “Engel class I”.
	36.	Driving Status
Indicate whether the patient is currently cleared to drive or has restrictions due to epilepsy.
	37.	Working Status
Describe the patient’s working status: employed, student, unemployed, or on disability.
	38.	Quality of Life Comments
Summarize any remarks about functional status or impact of epilepsy on daily life, social life, or well-being.

If any information is missing or not found in the reports, explicitly state “not mentioned” for that variable.

Do not guess or make assumptions. Use only information present in the text.
