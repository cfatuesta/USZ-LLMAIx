You are tasked with extracting specific patient information from a provided medical record text.

Your goal is to accurately identify and extract the following data points:
	1.	Patient ID
	2.	Age of the patient
	3.	Diagnosis status:
	•	Indicate if the patient has a diagnosis of epilepsy (Yes/No)
	•	If Yes, specify if the epilepsy is focal or generalized (Yes/No for each type)
	4.	Current medications:
	•	List the medications the patient is currently taking, including their respective doses if available.
	5.	Previous medications:
	•	Identify any medications the patient has previously taken but stopped, including:
	•	The name of the medication
	•	The reason for stopping each medication
	6.	Seizure frequency:
	•	Indicate the frequency of seizures experienced by the patient, measured in times per month.

Each data point should be clearly labeled. If any information is missing or not available, indicate this explicitly.
